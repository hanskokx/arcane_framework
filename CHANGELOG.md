## NEXT

- Added `of(context)` extension to `ArcaneService`

## 1.2.5

- Improved automatic metadata detection in `ArcaneLogger`

## 1.2.4

- Update package dependencies

## 1.2.3

- Added `ValueNotifier`s to both the `ArcaneAuthenticationService` and
  `ArcaneFeatureFlags`. This enables the possibility of listening for changes to
  either service.

### Example

```dart
// Listen to changes in the authentication status
Arcane.auth.isSignedIn.addListener(() {
  if (Arcane.auth.isSignedIn.value) {
    Arcane.log("User is signed in");
  } else {
    Arcane.log("User is signed out");
  }
});

// Listen to changes in the enabled/disabled features
Arcane.features.notifier.addListener(() {
  Arcane.log("Enabled features have been updated: ${Arcane.features.notifier.value}");
});
```

## 1.2.2

- Lowered minimum required collection dependency version to prevent forcing
  users into the latest Flutter release

## 1.2.1

- Lowered minimum required SDK version to prevent forcing users into the latest
  Flutter release

## 1.2.0

- Removed flutter_secure_storage dependency as it was unused

### Breaking Changes

The following methods have been moved outside of the ArcaneAuthInterface base
class:

- resendVerificationCode
- register
- confirmSignup
- resetPassword

These methods have been moved to mixin classes. To continue using them, please
update your ArcaneAuthInterface implementations.

- To use `resendVerificationCode`, `register` and `confirmSignup`, use the new
  `ArcaneAuthAccountRegistration` mixin.
- To use `resetPassword`, use the new `ArcaneAuthPasswordManagement` mixin.

### Migration

In order to migrate your existing interfaces, update them from:

```dart
class MyAuthInterface implements ArcaneAuthInterface {}
```

to:

```dart
class MyAuthInterface
    with ArcaneAuthAccountRegistration, ArcaneAuthPasswordManagement
    implements ArcaneAuthInterface {}
```

If the methods that these mixins provide are not being used, the mixins can
safely be omitted. If only one of these mixins is required, the other can be
safely omitted.

This change should result in fewer lines of code for interface implementations
that do not require these additional features.

## 1.1.7

- Fixed an issue with the `ArcaneAuthenticationService` where an exception would
  be thrown when attempting to access an authentication token while no
  `ArcaneAuthInterface` was registered.

## 1.1.6

- Updated logging feature to indicate the feature which was enabled or disabled
  within the log message, instead of only in the metadata.

## 1.1.5

- Update package dependencies. No code changes.

## 1.1.4

- Update package dependencies. No code changes.

## 1.1.3

- Arcane Auth no longer throws exceptions when log out fails, instead returning
  a `Result<void, String>`. This behavior matches the login method.

## 1.1.2

- Removed Flutter exception handling from `ArcaneLoggingService`, as this
  functionality should be defined by a users' interface.

### Migration

Add the following to your `ArcaneLoggingInterface`'s `init` method to replicate
the previous behavior:

```dart
// Handles unhandled Flutter errors by logging them.
FlutterError.onError = (errorDetails) {
  Arcane.log(
    errorDetails.exceptionAsString(),
    level: Level.error,
    module: errorDetails.library,
    stackTrace: errorDetails.stack,
  );
};

// Handles unhandled platform-specific errors by logging them.
PlatformDispatcher.instance.onError = (error, stack) {
  Arcane.log(
    "$error",
    level: Level.error,
    stackTrace: stack,
  );
  return false;
};
```
